# sensor-watch-ir-tools

Tools to establish two-way communication with a Sensor Watch pro, leveraging its onboard phototransistor and red LED.

The most interesting application is the ability to flash a new firmware onto the watch completely wirelessly, without needing to open and disassemble the watch.

> **Early prototype.** This works end-to-end on the bench (a full image and a delta
> patch have both flashed successfully on a `sensorwatch_pro`), but it is rough: you
> have to build a small probe yourself, the return link is finicky, and the watch must
> be running a development branch of the firmware. These instructions are written for
> the handful of early testers building the rig for the first time. Expect to fiddle.

The host tooling here pairs with the watch-side faces that can be found at the **`ir-comms`** branch of my [second-movement](https://github.com/alesgenova/second-movement/tree/ir-comms) fork:
- `firmware_flasher_face` and `firmware_flasher.py` to perform firmware updates
- `ir_rx_face` and `test_tx.py` to test out sending data to the watch
- `ir_tx_face` and `test_rx.py` to test out receiveing data from the watch

For an interactive explanation of the watch's memory map and the IR update
sequence, open [docs/index.html](docs/index.html) in a browser.

### Manage TOTP keys over IR

With the matching `totp_lfs_face` firmware running, open the TOTP face and
long-press Alarm to enter IR receive mode. Then use the USB modem:

```bash
bin/totp_manager.py list
bin/totp_manager.py add --file secrets.txt  # one otpauth:// URI per line
bin/totp_manager.py add                     # paste URIs interactively
bin/totp_manager.py remove 2                # zero-based index from list
bin/totp_manager.py move 4 1                # move key 4 into position 1
bin/totp_manager.py help                    # commands and options; no modem needed
```

Short-press Alarm to leave IR mode. `list` shows each URI's label (the path before
`?`), without transmitting or displaying the secret. `move FROM TO` (also
available as `reorder FROM TO`) shifts the intervening keys while preserving
each complete URI. Indices shift after a move or removal, so run `list` again
before changing another key. The old `bin/totp_sender.py`
entry point still runs the add workflow.

Running `bin/totp_manager.py` without a command opens a persistent `totp>`
prompt. It accepts `add otpauth://totp/...`, `list`, `remove INDEX`,
`move FROM TO`, `help`, and `quit`. A pasted URI alone still adds it. Commands
share the same modem session, and `help` does not send anything to the watch.

The TOTP wire protocol uses the shared serial frame format at 2400 baud to the
watch and 300 baud back. Frame flag 0 carries a URI and receives the legacy bare
two-byte ID ACK. Flag 1 lists keys (empty payload requests the count; a one-byte
zero-based index requests its label). Flag 2 removes the one-byte index. Flag 4
moves a key using two one-byte indices, source then destination. Management
replies are frames with flag 3, the same ID, and payload
`[request flag, status, data...]`; status 0 is success, 1 a malformed request,
2 an absent index, and 3 a storage error. The watch replays the last response
for a repeated ID and request flag, so retrying a remove or move cannot apply
the change twice. List, remove, and move require the matching watch firmware;
older firmware supports add only.

### Set the watch location over IR

On a watch with the matching firmware, open the Sunrise/Sunset face and
long-press **Light** to show `IrLoC / rEAdy`. Align the modem probe, then run:

```bash
bin/location_sender.py                 # suggest location from this computer's public IP
bin/location_sender.py -34.60 -58.38   # or enter coordinates directly
```

The sender shows its suggested coordinates and asks for confirmation before
transmitting. If IP lookup fails or its estimate is wrong, enter latitude and
longitude manually. IP geolocation can be imprecise, especially through a VPN.
Coordinates are decimal degrees (north/east positive) and are rounded to
hundredths of a degree. Short-press Alarm to leave IR mode. The watch writes
`location.u32`, which Sunrise/Sunset and Moon Phase read. The watch uses
`0.00, 0.00` as its unset sentinel, so that coordinate cannot be saved.
The Sunrise/Sunset receiver uses the current in-memory settings selected in
the Firmware Flasher face. Defaults are 3600 baud host-to-watch, 300 baud ACK,
NRZ, 8 Hz receive polling, 64 Hz ACK handling, and a four-tick ACK delay.
Changing flasher settings persists across face switches until reboot or a
flasher menu re-lock. Match any changed baud, encoding, or NRZ inversion on
the sender with `--baud`, `--ack-baud`, `--encoding`, `--rx-invert`, and
`--tx-invert`. The sender cannot read the watch menu remotely.

The request is one shared serial frame with flag `0x20` and an eight-byte
payload: ASCII `LOC1`, followed by signed latitude and longitude in
hundredths of a degree as little-endian 16-bit integers. The watch validates
both ranges, writes the location, and returns the bare two-byte frame ID as
an ACK. A retransmission of the same coordinates is safe. Invalid or failed
writes receive no ACK.

## 1. Get the code and run the flasher

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alesgenova/sensor-watch-ir-tools.git
cd sensor-watch-ir-tools

# Get the ultrapatch source code
git submodule update --init ultrapatch

# Python deps (a venv is recommended)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install pyserial          # always required
pip install detools           # for delta-patch flashing
```

### Build & flash the modem firmware

The modem firmware is built with [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/). Pick the env
that matches your board, plug it in over USB, and upload:

```bash
pio run -e modem_arduino_uno  -t upload     # Arduino UNO
# or
pio run -e modem_xiao_samd21  -t upload     # Seeed XIAO SAMD21
# or
pio run -e modem_esp32c3      -t upload     # ESP32-C3-DevKitM-1
```

Both modems are **identical from the host's point of view**: the Python script talks to
either one unchanged.

### Flash the watch

1. On the watch, open the **firmware-flasher face** and press the alarm button to get the watch ready to receive a new firmware.
2. Place the watch face down on the flasher enclosure, so that the IR LED and phototransistor are right under the watch display area (see the [photos](#the-prototype-flasher)).
3. Start the flasher script:

```bash
# Full flash of a fresh image:
bin/firmware_flasher.py firmware.uf2

# Delta patch against the firmware already on the watch:
bin/firmware_flasher.py new.uf2 --reference current.uf2
```

4. If the firmware chunks are not correctly received right away, nudge watch slightly to the left or right, until they are. Only very small adjustments are typically needed.

The defaults (NRZ encoding, 3600 baud data / 300 baud ACK) are the
[known-good settings](#default-settings) found by bench testing, don't change them unless you know what you're doing.

## Appendix

### The data frame

Every host → watch message travels in a fixed wire frame (defined in
`bin/serial_frame.py`, mirrored in the watch's `serial_frame.c`):

```
+----------+---------+-------------+---------+---------+
| preamble | id      | len + flags | payload | crc32   |
| 4 bytes  | 2 bytes | 2 bytes     | N bytes | 4 bytes |
+----------+---------+-------------+---------+---------+
            <------ CRC32 covers this ------>
```

- **preamble**: the fixed marker `AA 55 AA 55`. The receiver is a byte-fed state
  machine that hunts for this sequence, so it can find frame boundaries in a noisy
  stream and re-synchronise after any optical dropout.
- **id**: `uint16` (little-endian), application-defined. For data blocks it's a
  running counter (0, 1, 2, …). The control frames are identified by their flag
  bits (not their id); the host also gives them reserved ids by convention
  (`0xFFFF` = ENTER, `0xFFFE` = EXIT), which the watch just echoes in the ACK.
- **len + flags**: the low 10 bits are the payload length (capped at 512 bytes by
  `MAX_PAYLOAD`); the top 6 bits are flag bits (TEST, ENTER, VERIFY, PATCH).
- **payload**: padded up to a 4-byte boundary; the padding is covered by the CRC
  but not delivered. A declared length of 0 means no payload bytes on the wire.
- **crc32**: a standard CRC-32 (the same as `zlib.crc32`) computed over the id,
  the len+flags field, and the padded payload, i.e. everything **except** the
  preamble and the CRC itself.

**How corruption is caught.** The receiver recomputes the CRC-32 over the bytes it
got and compares it to the trailing CRC. Any single flipped bit anywhere in the id,
length, flags, or payload changes the computed CRC, so the frame fails the check and
is **discarded**, never delivered to the flasher. A frame with a nonsensical length
field (noise that happened to match the preamble) is rejected outright and the parser
resyncs. Because the preamble is a distinct marker and the machine resyncs on any
mismatch, a garbled or partial frame can't be mistaken for a good one: worst case it
fails CRC and the sender, having received no acknowledgement, retransmits it.

**The acknowledgement (watch → host)** is *not* a frame: the watch replies to a valid
frame with the bare 2-byte id (little-endian), raw, with no preamble or CRC. This is
self-validating. The host is waiting for one specific id (the one it just sent), so
a corrupted ACK simply fails to match and the frame is retried, while a matching id is
proof the frame arrived intact (the watch only ACKs *after* the frame passed its own
CRC). On the weak watch → host path the watch can repeat the id several times per ACK
(the `Acnt` knob); the host scans a small sliding window for any intact copy.

### Analog vs Digital RX

Analog RX (default) samples the phototransistor with the ADC and decodes it with a self-tuning slicer. This a less elegant implementation, but it proved to just work better: it works in wider range of ambient lighting conditions.
The original Digital RX implementation can be used with the `--digital-rx` option. This mode detects edges on the raw pin: it's potentially faster but it actually behaves worse with the low intensity signal that is received from the watch.

### Flasher logic flow

1. **Link test (test + ACK).** The host sends the first few firmware blocks as
   `TEST`-flagged frames. The watch validates each, echoes its id, but does **not**
   write it to flash. Each frame is retransmitted up to `--retries` times (default 50).
   This finite limit is unique to the test phase (real data blocks are retried forever);
   the test fails only if a frame still can't be ACKed after all its retries, and the
   retransmit counts are reported so you can gauge link quality before committing. This
   proves the full round-trip (both the host → watch data path and the finicky
   watch → host ACK path) *before* anything irreversible happens.

2. **ENTER command.** Once the test passes, the host sends an `ENTER` frame (id
   `0xFFFF`, FLAG_ENTER, empty payload), retransmitting until it's ACKed. ENTER drops
   the watch out of its test stage and into a wait-for-first-block stage. The first
   data block hands control to the RAM-resident flasher. The ACK is sent before
   that hand-off, so a lost ENTER-ACK just makes the host resend, which is harmless.
   *(With `--reference` the ENTER instead carries a 20-byte patch header, and the watch
   ACKs it only if its current flash matches the reference (otherwise the patch is
   refused); the data frames then stream a compressed delta applied in place.)*

3. **RAM-resident flasher (overlay).** While the flash controller is erasing or
   programming a row, the CPU can't fetch instructions from flash, so the entire
   flashing loop lives in a RAM overlay copied from flash at first-block time. On entry it
   disables interrupts, closes the normal optical driver and brings the RX/TX SERCOMs
   up raw, disables the flash cache (so the read-back verify sees true flash), and
   sleeps in STANDBY between bytes. From here the watch is off Movement's event loop
   entirely.

4. **Data frames.** The firmware streams in as data blocks: id = running counter,
   payload = a 4-byte target flash address + one 256-byte flash row. For each block
   the watch erases the target row, programs it, then ACKs by echoing the id. It's
   stop-and-wait with de-duplication: a repeat of the last-written id is just re-ACKed
   (lost-ACK recovery), the next id is written and advances the counter, and a failed
   write sends no ACK so the host retransmits forever, because the watch never gives
   up mid-flash.

5. **EXIT command.** After the last block the host sends an `EXIT` frame (id `0xFFFE`,
   FLAG_VERIFY, a 12-byte descriptor = base address, total length, whole-image CRC-32).
   The watch CRCs the flash region it just wrote and compares. **Match** → it echoes the
   id and reboots straight into the new firmware. **Mismatch** → it stays silent and
   parked in the RAM overlay (it never reboots into a half-written image), and the host
   reports the failure and offers to resend. There is deliberately **no stall timeout**:
   an abandoned session just sits parked in RAM, still reachable over the link, rather
   than rebooting into a possibly-bricked image.

> **Recovery.** The watch never leaves the `.ramfunc` flasher until a final verification
> passes; it only reboots on an EXIT whose CRC matches. Until then, the host can restart
> the entire write at any time simply by sending a data block with **id = 0**: the watch

### IrDA vs NRZ encoding

The link can run in either of two line encodings (chosen with `--encoding`, and matched
on the watch): **IrDA** (SIR pulse coding) or plain **NRZ** (a normal UART line). The
default is NRZ, which is slightly counter-intuitive, since IrDA is the one designed to
save power.

In IrDA SIR the line idles LOW and each `0` bit is sent as a brief HIGH pulse lasting
only 3/16 of a bit period. On a typical active-HIGH LED (LED on when the line is HIGH)
that is exactly the low-power trick it's meant to be: the LED sits dark at idle and
flashes on only for those short pulses.

The catch is that the Sensor Watch's red LED is wired **active-LOW**: it lights when the
line is LOW. That inverts IrDA's intent. The idle-LOW line now keeps the LED **lit** most
of the time (scope-measured at roughly 80% duty), blinking *off* for each pulse instead
of on. So on this hardware IrDA is actually the power-*hungry* option, it maximises
LED-on time rather than minimising it. (The link still works because the IrDA receiver
keys off pulse edges/position, not absolute light level.)

NRZ does the opposite: the line idles HIGH, so the LED is **off** at idle and only pulled
on for start/data bits. During a flash the line is idle far more often than not (between
bytes and between frames), so NRZ keeps the LED dark most of the time. It tested just as
reliably as IrDA on this jig, so it's the default, and it's gentler on the coin cell.
