"""firmware_flasher: flash a UF2 image to the watch over IR, frame by frame.

Companion to the `modem_arduino_uno` firmware (src/modem_arduino_uno.cpp). The modem
is a dumb half-duplex byte pipe; ALL of the protocol lives here:

  * Parse the UF2 file into per-block (targetAddr, firmware data) payloads.
  * Wrap each payload in a serial frame (preamble + id + len/flags +
    padded payload + CRC32), matching watch-library/shared/utils/serial_frame.c.
  * Link test (--test-blocks): send the first M blocks with the TEST flag,
    mirroring the watch's flash TEST mode. Each is retried up to --retries times
    and the run aborts if one still can't be ACKed: a reliability gate before
    committing to a real flash. The watch only ACKs these; it does not commit them.
  * Stop-and-wait: send one frame, then wait for the watch's acknowledgement,
    which is the bare 2-byte frame id (little-endian) echoed back. If it
    doesn't arrive within the timeout, retransmit the same frame.
  * Print progress over stdout.

The modem USB command/message protocol is documented in bin/ir_modem.py and the
frame wire format in bin/serial_frame.py (both shared with bin/test_rx.py).

The watch side: the firmware_flasher_face receives a frame, validates its CRC,
and (in the real flash stage) commits it, then replies with the bare 2-byte id.
A corrupted reply simply fails to match the id we're waiting for, so we retry.

# built before the beacon exist in the wild: they fail the guard (override
# with --allow-no-flasher-face if you knowingly flash one) and provide no
